                This area is where I have industry knowdedge. I did not work on data engineering projects, but my superior 
                is the data analyst manager. Therefore, I have worked with data analysis project involving internal data. 
                These projects taught me a lot on why we are doing these projects as well as the important of the flied in 
                business setting as well as decision making.

                I am most familar with Tableau and Microsoft Excel. However, I think for Microsoft Excel, there is a lot to 
                learn as I am too familiar with Macro the developer tools in MS Excel. All my projects that I have worked on 
                are using Tableau. It is very easy with the interface. However, I want to develop my own UI as some point because 
                there are definitely feature I would want to have such as many different functionality buttons to have a more 
                interactive dashboard.
