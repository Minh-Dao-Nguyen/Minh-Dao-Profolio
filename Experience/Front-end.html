                Front end is where I am most expereience in. I have been developing in the is area through working at
                the
                Texas A&M
                Office for Academic Innovation as a Support Specilist in front end development and data analysis.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I work on almost all emails sent out by the Office to 30,000+ faculty and 70,000+ students across all
                Texas
                A&M campus.
                I was tasked with 100% process of making the emails. Currently, as I also tasked with data analysis
                task, I
                am more focused
                on testing the emails as well as add functionality and accessibility for moblie width thanks to the
                technical and CSS skills
                I have developed previously. I am confidence in my HTML/CSS email skills becuase I have been working on
                them
                a lot.

                Current, I am now dutied with improving the Texas A&M learning mangaging system website with
                functionality
                buttons and features using
                my knowledge in JavaScript.

                My next biggest learning curve in Front end development was working on this personal profolio.
                Everything on
                this Profolio
                is written from scratch, including all animation and styling. I have been learning a lot of JavaScript
                on my
                own as well as
                further my development in CSS. I am very pround of this profolio, especially the home page becuase all
                the
                animation is written from
                scratch using fundamental programming concepts and logic.
