                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howdy, my name is Minh Dao Nguyen. I am currently pursuing a bachelor degree in
                Computer Science and two minor in Math as well as Cyber Security at Texas A&M. I
                am originated from Vietnam and started my studying in the United States since 2017.
                I have been enjoying my experience and what I have been learning in University. I have
                been given greeat oportunities to pusue my passion in Computer Science and I am very
                grateful for it. I am excited for the future as well as the innovations that we continue
                developing as a scociety.

                Why Computer Science ?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always love to building, innovating, and solving problems. As typical as it is,
                I showed my interest in this area through drawing on my home's wall, Lego, and most significantly,
                Minecraft. I have always want to be an inventor and an Engineer to satisfy my curiosity and passion for
                buidling. Then, I found out about Programming. What I hook me into it is the simplicity and the freedom
                it gives. All you need is a computer and you can create anything you want. The limitation is really your knowledge
                and imagination, which you can have total control over. My journey is determined on how hard I work and how dedicated I am,
                and that is one of the main reason why I enjoy Computer Science so much.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love facing challenges and overcoming them. That is the characteristic 
                that got me through the summer semesters with 4 classes and working 34+ hours a week. To me, challenges shapes who 
                we are and define our character. By conquering them, we prepare our mind and body for the next harder challenges 
                that lead to us having a more fulfilling and meaningful life. Therefore, I love software engineering because of 
                the constant challenges and problems it has during development. The long hours staring at your screen and trying 
                to figure out the answer are tiring, but the emotions after it passed all test cases are undoubtedly worth it to 
                sacrifice for. The best thing is that you get better at solving problems and debugging.

                My Focus area

            <p class="text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pursuing Software Engineering in Cybersecurity. I want to contribute
                to something that is ethical. As our society is more and more emerged with technologies, we are subjected to the danger
                to the tools that we created. Data, information, privacy are easy to be stolen and used by peolple for their own personal
                interest. Therefore, I want to contribute to this industry by preventing the miss used of tools and knowledge. I strongly 
                believe that there is evil and malevolent, but we have the choice to fight against it.

            Hobbies
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to hobbies, the two main things I enjoy doing is
            video games and exercising. There two things are what built my characters and placed me where I am today. 
            Video games are actually what taught me English. Long story short, consuming Minecraft content and researching 
            more about the game taught how to speak and write in English. It is rather an amusing story that I am known for.
            Exercising is what of the main thing that taught me about working hard and enjoying the process. I have been going
            to the gym for 6 or 7 years. Throughout this journey, I learned the importance of discipline and enjoying the process.
            Those are what necessary for me to reach where I am today. Not only that, I belive that they are also what necessary to 
            have a fulfilling life.
