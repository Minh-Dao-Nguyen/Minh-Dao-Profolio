                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howdy, my name is Minh Dao Nguyen. I am currently pursuing a bachelor degree in
                Computer Science and two minor in Math as well as Cyber Security at Texas A&M. I
                am originated from Vietnam and started my studying in the United States since 2017.
                I have been enjoying my experience and what I have been learning in University. I have
                been given greeat oportunities to pusue my passion in Computer Science and I am very
                grateful for it. I am excited for the future as well as the innovations that we continue
                developing as a scociety.

                Why Computer Science ?
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always love to building, innovating, and solving problems. As typical as it is,
                I showed my interest in this area through drawing on my home's wall, Lego, and most significantly,
                Minecraft. I have always want to be an inventor and an Engineer to satisfy my curiosity and passion for
                buidling. Then, I found out about Programming. What I hook me into it is the simplicity and the freedom
                it gives.
                All you need is a computer and you can create anything you want. The limitation is really your knowledge
                and
                imagination, which you can have total control over.
