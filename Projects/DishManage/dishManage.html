                This project is a Java Application for managing dishes/menu of a restaurant. This application is a full-stack 
                build where it has a database, GUI, and back-end. The application is built on Netbean and it used Netbean local 
                database. The main two languages used are Java and SQL. This project follow through a professional development process 
                where it was desinged, documented, and has criterias to meet.

            <p class="text">
                Before building the program, I set aside some time ( about a week ) to plan out what the
program would look like as well as its classes, functions, structures, data, and all other features.
This process helps me have a clear idea of where to go and to start. This also helps me
understand the relationship between each class, its functions, and its structures. This step is also
essential for building a GUI frame.<br>
This file contains both my initial design for the program as well as the final amendment I
made before building the program. It does not include all the previous amendments made before
reaching the final stage since the file would be too long. There were almost 3 to 5 rough GUI
sketches before the final one is made.<br>
The file does not contain all the flow chart for all the algorithms I made since a lot of
algorithms is developed during the programming/building process.

            <p class="text">
                This file is written after the program is built. This file contains all the GUI frame and
their navigation.<br>
Most importantly, this file contains all the ingredients that I built for the program such as
sorting algorithm, String combining, Array manipulation, etc. There are also descriptions of how
the algorithm works but only for some of them.<br>
It also contains the tool and techniques I used. Those are mostly the features or
fundamental pillars of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

                This file is written for me to evaluate on my program and if all the features I set out are
met. It also where I put down ideas on how I can improve the programs with new features.<br>
This file is also modified to be read by other than myself and it is reader-friendly.
